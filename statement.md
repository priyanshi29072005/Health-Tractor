# Problem Statement
Many people struggle to maintain consistent healthy habits such as adequate sleep, hydration, nutrition, exercise, and controlled screen time. Existing methods like manual tracking or generic apps often lack personalization, motivation, or simplicity, resulting in users losing engagement or not gaining meaningful insights into their health behaviors.

# Scope of the Project
This project aims to build a straightforward, user-friendly habit tracking tool focused on key health metrics. It provides a simple scoring system and feedback based on daily inputs related to sleep, water intake, protein consumption, screen time, walking, and meals. The tool is designed primarily for personal use, encouraging users to monitor and improve their health habits gradually.
